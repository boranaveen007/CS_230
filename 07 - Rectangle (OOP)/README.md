# 07 - Rectangle (OOP)

## What we were instructed to do:

> The purpose of this lab is to give you practice creating your own object. You will be given a main function that expects an instance of the (yet undefined) Rectangle object.

Your job is to determine what attributes and methods the Rectangle class requires and create a class that will satisfy the requirements.

## What I did:

> I used **TKinter** to create a GUI for this project. The app takes in the width and height of the rectangle object, and then creates it on screen, as well as displaying the area & perimeter of the created rectangle.

NOTE:
> This is tested on a Mac, and **SHOULD** work on Windows, but it is not certain.

## How to run this project

* Begin by cloning or downloading the entire *CS_230* repository from GitHub.
* Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
    * Open Command Prompt on Windows or Terminal on Mac.
    * Type `python --version` and press **Enter**.
    * > Depending how you have Python installed, you may have to run `python3 --version` to see your Python 3 version number.
    * If you see a version starting with 3.6.x, you have a suitable version installed. 
    * If you do not, install the latest version here: [Download Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Open the *CS_230* folder on your machine, find the *07 - Rectangle (OOP)* folder, and open it in Command Prompt on Windows and Terminal on Mac.
* Type `python main.py` and press **Enter** to run the basic assignemnt, or type `python main_gui.py` to run the black belt version of the project.
    > Depending on how you have **Python** setup, you may have to run `python3 `, followed by the program/file name.


## Summary 
This assignment challenge me by having to figure out how to accept input from the user in a GUI with TKinter. I enjoyed creating yet another desktop app in Python. In the next assignment, I move away from desktop however, and create a web app using **Bottle.py**. Check it out!

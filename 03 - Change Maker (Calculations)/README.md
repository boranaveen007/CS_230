# 03 - Change Maker (Calculations)

## What we were instructed to do:

> Create a program that calculates change after a purchase. This will be a sequential algorithm, which is one of the simplest programming patterns. Your solution requires no branching or looping. Simply write a series of statements that will execute in order.

## What I did:

> Introduced myself to OOP by creating Register, Menu, and other classes to break up the program. I then print out a menu to the user, and allow them to add food items by name to their order. Once they complete the order, I tell them their total and ask how much they have to pay. I then tender their change and ask if they would like a receipt. If they would, I create a *receipt.txt* and open it up. 

NOTE:
> This is tested on a Mac, and **SHOULD** work on Windows, but it is not certain.

## How to run this project

* Begin by cloning or downloading the entire *CS_230* repository from GitHub.
* Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
    * Open Command Prompt on Windows or Terminal on Mac.
    * Type `python --version` and press **Enter**.
    * > Depending how you have Python installed, you may have to run `python3 --version` to see your Python 3 version number.
    * If you see a version starting with 3.6.x, you have a suitable version installed. 
    * If you do not, install the latest version here: [Download Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Open the *CS_230* folder on your machine, find the *03 - Change Maker (Calculations)* folder, and open it in Command Prompt on Windows and Terminal on Mac.
* Type `python change_maker.py` and press **Enter** to run the basic assignemnt, or type `python change_maker_black_belt.py` to run the black belt version of the project.
    > Depending on how you have **Python** setup, you may have to run `python3 `, followed by the program/file name.


## Summary 
In this assigment, I really enjoyed diving deep into OOP with concepts such as encapsulation, and and composition. I also enjoyed solving the issue of creating a file on the user's computer to create the reciept and then opening it for them. I though that was a neat little trick to suprise my user. Check our my later projects for even more fun twists.

# Change Maker - First OOP Python Project (CLI)

This was my first Object Oriented Programming program. It uses a menu to ask you what you want and builds an order, then totals the price, and tenders the change back to you.
Then it asks if you want a reciept, and can print one off for you via creating a .txt file and opens it.  It was fun figuring out how to do this on Mac and Windows.

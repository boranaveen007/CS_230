# 04 - Guessing Game (Flow Control)

## What we were instructed to do:

> Create a program that illustrates your understanding of conditions. Create a "High-Low" game which allows the user to play a game with the computer. The game will require input, output, branching and loop behaviors by requiring the user to continue to guess numbers until they guess the number the computer generated.

## What I did:

> I completed the basic assignment, and a 'blackbelt' assignment that was the reverse of the original. It required the user to pick a number, and then the computer would guess it.

NOTE:
> This is tested on a Mac, and **SHOULD** work on Windows, but it is not certain.

## How to run this project

* Begin by cloning or downloading the entire *CS_230* repository from GitHub.
* Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
    * Open Command Prompt on Windows or Terminal on Mac.
    * Type `python --version` and press **Enter**.
    * > Depending how you have Python installed, you may have to run `python3 --version` to see your Python 3 version number.
    * If you see a version starting with 3.6.x, you have a suitable version installed. 
    * If you do not, install the latest version here: [Download Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Open the *CS_230* folder on your machine, find the *04 - Guessing Game (Flow Control)* folder, and open it in Command Prompt on Windows and Terminal on Mac.
* Type `python guessing_game.py` and press **Enter** to run the basic assignemnt, or type `python guessing_game_black_belt.py` to run the black belt version of the project.
    > Depending on how you have **Python** setup, you may have to run `python3 `, followed by the program/file name.


## Summary 
This assignment was not too exciting or difficult for me, and it was during this time that I began to teach myself a little bit about GUIs in Python. Check out my next assigment, the Card Game, to see my favorite GUI I created for this class. (Other than the final project)

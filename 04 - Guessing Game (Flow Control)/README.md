# 05 - Cryptography (String Manipulation)

## What we were instructed to do:

> Create a program that assists in a basic form of cryptography, a substitution cypher. Write a program that will accept a phrase and convert it into code by substituting letters according to a key. Your program should encrypt and decrypt messages.

## What I did:

> I completed the basic assignment, and a 'blackbelt' assignment in which I allowed users to create unique **base keys** that would help protect their encrypted messages from just anyone who had this program. I did this by creating the encoding base by running an algorithm over the unique base key that the user provided. Each base key results in a different encoding base for encrypting and decrypting.

NOTE:
> This is tested on a Mac, and **SHOULD** work on Windows, but it is not certain.

## How to run this project

* Begin by cloning or downloading the entire *CS_230* repository from GitHub.
* Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
    * Open Command Prompt on Windows or Terminal on Mac.
    * Type `python --version` and press **Enter**.
    * > Depending how you have Python installed, you may have to run `python3 --version` to see your Python 3 version number.
    * If you see a version starting with 3.6.x, you have a suitable version installed. 
    * If you do not, install the latest version here: [Download Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Open the *CS_230* folder on your machine, find the *05 - Cryptography (String Manipulation)* folder, and open it in Command Prompt on Windows and Terminal on Mac.
* Type `python cryptography.py`  or `python crypto.py` and press **Enter** to run the basic assignemnt, or type `python cryptography_black_belt.py` to run the black belt version of the project.
    > Depending on how you have **Python** setup, you may have to run `python3 `, followed by the program/file name.


## Summary 
This assignment was also not very eventful, but allowed me a chance to move on to the next assignment early and create several versions of it, each one being more complicated and awesome than the last. I highly reccommend checking out that next assignment, Card Game. (Especially the **GUI** version!)

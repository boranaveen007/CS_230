# BMI - First Bottle.py Web App

This was my first web app.  Used Bottle.py, which is a verison of Flask.  This web app just calculates BMI of a user.
Two page app. I included full error checking for the form.

### To run the app:

* Clone to your machine.
* Navigate to BMI directory.
* run python app.py.
* Use your browser to go to the url specified.
* Find out your BMI.

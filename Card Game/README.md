# Card Game - First GUI Program (TKinter)

This was a series of card games written in various ways.  The first one uses a single dimensional array to hold all deck info as card location. Pretty interesting concept. The second and third are Black Jack Games, text based. The first of these is single player and the second is multi player (up to 4 or 5 I believe.) The last one was my first attempt into a GUI.  I used TKinter to make a old fashioned looking card game interface, and I had a lot of fun doing it.

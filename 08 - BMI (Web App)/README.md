# 08 - BMI (Web App)

## What we were instructed to do:

> Demonstrate your ability to create a graphic user interface in Python using HTML and CSS. Create a simple web server with Bottle. Build a web application which prompts the user for his or her height and weight, sends that data to another page, which calculates the BMI as well as some feedback.

## What I did:

> I got this project done quite a bit ahead of time to give myself more time for the final project. Therefore, I did not do much extra to this project, besides using Bootstrap's CSS to make it look much better. Neverless this was a fun app to build and introduced me to web apps in general.

NOTE:
> This is tested on a Mac, and **SHOULD** work on Windows, but it is not certain.

## How to run this project

* Begin by cloning or downloading the entire *CS_230* repository from GitHub.
* Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
    * Open Command Prompt on Windows or Terminal on Mac.
    * Type `python --version` and press **Enter**.
    * > Depending how you have Python installed, you may have to run `python3 --version` to see your Python 3 version number.
    * If you see a version starting with 3.6.x, you have a suitable version installed. 
    * If you do not, install the latest version here: [Download Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Open the *CS_230* folder on your machine, find the *04 - Guessing Game (Flow Control)* folder, and open it in Command Prompt on Windows and Terminal on Mac.
* Type `python app.py` and press **Enter** to run the this web app.
    > Depending on how you have **Python** setup, you may have to run `python3 `, followed by the program/file name.
* Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8080/ in your browser to check out the web app.


## Summary 
This assignment introduced me to routing and using HTML and CSS with Python. I enjoyed using Bottle, but chose to use DJango with Python to build my Inventory Managment System for my final project. Check it out here: [Final Project](https://github.com/djpeach/InventoryManagementDashboard)

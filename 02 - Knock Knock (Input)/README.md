# 02 - Knock Knock (Input)

## What we were instructed to do:

> Create a version of the famous "Hello World" project - with a twist. Write a program that asks the user's name, greets the user by name, and tells a knock-knock joke.

## What I did:

> Created the basic assignment, then did a 'blackbelt' version. In this version, I did a knock knock joke that was an allusion to both Monty Python, and the 'Orange you glad I didn't say banana' joke. I also tested for valid answers, and differed what happened based on these answers.

## How to run this project

* Begin by cloning or downloading the entire *CS_230* repository from GitHub.
* Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
    * Open Command Prompt on Windows or Terminal on Mac.
    * Type `python --version` and press **Enter**.
    * > Depending how you have Python installed, you may have to run `python3 --version` to see your Python 3 version number.
    * If you see a version starting with 3.6.x, you have a suitable version installed. 
    * If you do not, install the latest version here: [Download Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Open the *CS_230* folder on your machine, find the *02 - Knock Knock (Input)* folder, and open it in Command Prompt on Windows and Terminal on Mac.
* Type `python knock_knock_basic.py` and press **Enter** to run the basic assignemnt, or type `python knock_knock_black_belt.py` to run the black belt version of the project.


## Summary 
This project is incredibly simple looking back, but at the time I was excited to use Python and do things with my program to make it at lease a little better. Check out some of my later projects to see how I did much more advanced programs and GUIs later on in the class.

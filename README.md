My first programs

These python programs are the first that I ever built as a Computer Science Major at IUPUI. In all of the class assignemnts, I went well above and beyond the minimum requirements to both challenge myself, and enjoy what I had built. I particularly enjoyed the projects with TKinter and Web apps. 

The journey these programs took me on in one semester was incredible. I went from nearly no programming experience to building neat, fun, and eventually powerful apps that I was proud to show off. I plan to continue learning and growing in my Computer Science Career, and cannot wait to see what is next!

To see my final project for this class, check out the repo I have it in here on github. **https://github.com/djpeach/InventoryManagementDashboard**

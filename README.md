# CS_230
Projects done for my first CS class. Not the best, but still proud of them

### Each app includes its own README to tell you a little about the app and how I built it, as well as how to run it.

This class saw me go from almost no programming experience, to creating my first serious app for the final project at the end of the year.  The amount I learned was incredible, and I have thouroughly enjoyed it.  I cannot wait to see what CS is like after this!

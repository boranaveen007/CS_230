# CS_230
My first programs

### Each app includes its own README to tell you a little about the app and how I built it, as well as how to run it.

These are all programs I built during CS_230 at IUPUI.  I went from almost no programming experience to building a decent web application at the end of the semester for my final project. **https://github.com/djpeach/InventoryManagementDashboard**
I enjoyed every bit of it, and can't wait to see what's next!
